    \caption{\textbf{Definition of trend groupings}. We subdivide states into ``stagnation" states and "reversal" states based on comparison of trends in total \pmt between early and recent periods, and then subdivide those based on whether they were smoke-influenced. The $\beta$'s refer to period-specific estimated slopes on \pmt: $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are first- and second-period slopes on total \pmt, $\beta^*_1$ and $\beta^*_2$ are corresponding period slopes for non-smoke \pmt.  Strong inequalities ($>$ or $<$) have to be statistically significant ($p<0.05$) for condition to be met. }

       Smoke-influenced Stagnation  & $<0$ & $\leq0$ \& $> \beta_1$ &  & $< \beta_2$ & \emph{A stagnation where recent period \pmt would have declined more quickly without smoke.} \\
       Smoke-caused Reversal   & $<0$ & $>0$ &  & $<0$ & \emph{A reversal where second-period total \pmt would have declined absent smoke.} \\
       Smoke-influenced Reversal  & $<0$ & $>0$ &  & $<\beta_2$ & \emph{A reversal where second period total \pmt would not have declined absent smoke, but increases would have been at a lower rate.}\\
       Smoke-influenced, no early decline  & $\geq 0$ &  &  & $<\beta_2 $ & \emph{Smoke influenced total \pmt trends in the second period, but there was no detectable decline in total \pmt during the first period.} \\
       Smoke influence not detected  &  &  &  & $=\beta_2$ & \emph{We did not detect an influence of smoke on total \pmt trends.} \\
