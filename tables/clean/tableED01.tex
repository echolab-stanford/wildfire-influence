    % \caption{\textbf{Definition of trend groupings}. We subdivide states into ``stagnation" states and "reversal" states based on comparison of trends in total \pmt between early and recent periods, and then subdivide those based on whether they were smoke-influenced. Coefficients refer to period-specific estimated slopes on \pmt: $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are first- and second-period slopes on total \pmt, $\beta^\prime_1$ and $\beta^\prime_2$ are corresponding period slopes for non-smoke \pmt.  Strong inequalities ($>$ or $<$) have to be statistically significant ($p<0.05$) for condition to be met. }
